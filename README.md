# Description
This takes several sorting algorithms and plots their runtimes on a graph. This allows us to have a visual for comparing each algorithm

## Algorithms involved
- Heapsort
- Quicksort
    - Randomized Quicksort
- Mergesort
- Insertion sort
- Bubble Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bucket Sort
